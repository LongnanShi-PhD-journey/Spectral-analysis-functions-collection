  # Description: Pre-processing method for spectral data: SNV which is also known 
  #              as z-transformation or as centring and scaling (operating per 
  #              spectrum or row-wise) normalizes each spectrum to zero mean and 
  #              unit variance by subtracting the mean of the spectrum and 
  #              dividing the difference by its standard deviation
  #
  # Input: Data Frame with col names and row names
  #
  # Output: Data Frame with col names an row names
